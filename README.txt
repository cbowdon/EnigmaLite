This is an app to solve substitution ciphers.

Matt Shaw's idea:
"Can you decipher this message?" posts turn up on Reddit occasionally, and the hivemind usually manages it. But if it's just a simple substitution cipher, an algorithm that matches character frequency in the ciphered text with character frequency in the target language would have a high probability of successfully decoding it. Potential solutions can be scored by what fraction of the solution are recognised words in the target language.

So here's a program to do that. The .NET work is the main program; the Python program is just a demo; the Racket files are just utilities/test files.
